# CS201_Project

Java Implementations of Unsorted List (Brute Force), Unbalanced KD Tree, Balanced KD Tree- Recursive Partioning, Balanced KD Tree- Presorting, and Vantage Point Trees to find the businesses within a cutoff distance in **both** dimensions of the xy plane from an input coordinate. 

To run the program, follow these instructions:

1. Place `yelp_academic_dataset_business.json` in `/CS201_Group_Project`. 

The json file contains 160,585 original businesses (businesses in the original `yelp_academic_dataset_business.json` available at https://www.yelp.com/dataset) and 839,425 (1,000,010 - 160,585) randomly generated businesses. The randomly generated businesses are added to test the performance of the algorithms with an input size of n = 1,000,000.

2. Run the following command: `mvn spring-boot:run` at `/CS201_Group_Project`.

3. Follow the command line instructions.
